# Sustainability Pillar

## What is the Sustainability pillar?
When building cloud workloads, the practice of sustainability is understanding the impacts of the services used, quantifying impacts through the entire workload lifecycle, and appplying design principles and best practices to reduce there impacts. This module focuses on environmental impacts, especially energy consumption and efficiency, since they are important levers for architects to inform direct action to reduce resource usage.

## Sustainability design principles
* Understand your impact
* Establish sustainability goals
* Maximize utilization
* Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offerings.
* Use managed service
* Reduce the downstream impact of your cloud workloads

## Sustainability best practice areas
* Region selection
* Alignment to demand
* Software and architecture pattern
* Data patterns
* Hardware and services
* Process and culture

## Region selection
Chose Region based on both business requirements and sustainability goals.

## Alignment to demand
* Scale infrastructure with user load
* Align SLAs with sustainability goals
* Stop the creation and maintenance of unused assets
* Optimize geographic placement of workloads for user locations
* Optimize team member resources for activities performed
* Implement buffering or throttling to flatten the demand curve

## Software and architecture patterns
* Optimize software and architecture for asynchronous and scheduled jobs
* Remove or refactor workload components with low or no use
* Optimize areas of code that consume the most time or resources
* Optimize impact on customer devices and equipment
* Use software patterns and architectures

## Data patterns
* Implement a data classification policy
* Use technologies that support data access and storage patterns
* Use policies to manage the lifecycle of your datasets
* Use elasticity and automation to expand block storage or file system
* Remove unneeded or redundant data
* Use share file systems or object storage to access common data.
* Minimize data movement across networks
* Back up data only when difficult to recreate

## Hardware and services
* Use the minimum amount of hardware to meet your needs
* Use instance types with the least impact
* Use managed services
* Optimize your use of hardware-based compute accelerators

# Process and culture
* Adopt methods that can rapidly introduce sustainability improvements
* Keep your workload up-to-date
* Increase utilization of build environments
* Use managed device farms for testing

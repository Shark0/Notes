# Performance Efficiency Pillar

## What is the performance efficiency pillar?
The performance efficiency pillar focuses on the efficient use of computing resources to meet requirements, and how to maintain efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.

## Performance Efficiency Design Principles
* Democratize advanced technologies.
* Go global in minutes
* Use serverless architectures.
* Experiment more often.
* Consider mechanical sympathy.

## Performance efficiency best practice areas
* Selection
* Review 
* Monitoring
* Trade-offs

## Performance architecture selection
* Understand the available services and resources
* Define a process for architectural choices
* Factor cost requirements into decisions
* Use policies or reference architectures
* Use guidance from your cloud provider or an appropriate partner
* Benchmark existing workloads.
* Load test your workload.

## Compute architecture selection
* Understand available compute configuration options
* Evaluate available compute options
* Collect compute-related metrics
* Determine required configuration by rightsizing
* User available elasticity of resources
* Continually evaluate compute needs based on metrics.

## Storage architecture selection
* Understand storage characteristics and requirements
* Make decisions based on access patterns and metrics
* Evaluate available configuration options

## Database architecture selection
* Understand data characteristics
* Evaluate the available options
* Collect and record database performance metrics
* Choose data storage based on access patterns
* Optimize data storage based on access patterns and metrics

## Network architecture selection
* Understand how networking impacts performance
* Evaluate available networking features
* Choose appropriately sized dedicated connectivity or VPN for hybrid workloads.
* Leverage load-balancing and encryption offloading
* Choose network protocols to improve performance
* Choose your workload's location based on network requirements
* Optimize network configuration based on metrics
* 

## Evolve your workload to take advantage of new releases
* Stay up-to-date on new resources and services
* Define a process to improve workload performance
* Evolve workload performance over time

## Monitor resources to ensure expected performance
* Record performance-related metrics
* Analyze metrics when events or incidents occur
* Establish KPIs to measure workload performance
* Use monitoring to generate alarm-based notifications
* Review metrics at regular intervals
* Monitor and alarm practively

## Using trade-offs to improve performance
* Understand areas where performance is most critical
* Learn about design patterns and services
* Identify how trad-offs impact customers and efficiency
* Measure impact of performance improvements 
* Use various performance-related strategies
